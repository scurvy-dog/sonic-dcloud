# Welcome to the SONiC on Cisco 8000 Emulator Lab

### Description: This repository contains lab guide, router configs, setup scripts, and other code for running through the lab.

SONiC is an open source network operating system based on Linux that runs on switches/routers from multiple vendors and ASICs. SONiC offers a full-suite of network functionality, like BGP, that has been production-hardened in the data centers of some of the largest cloud-service providers.

Though it is easy to run SONiC in a virtualized lab environment, what this lab brings is the ability to run SONiC on a platform that emulates the Cisco 8000 hardware. That allows for data-plane feature enablement such as QoS, hardware counters, and debug tools. 

The lab software stack is built off the SONiC master build with Cisco specific platform drivers for the Cisco 8000 hardware.
