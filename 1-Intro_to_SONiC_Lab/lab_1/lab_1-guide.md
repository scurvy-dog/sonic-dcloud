# Lab 1 Guide: SONiC Topology Setup and Validation [30 Min]
This dCloud lab makes heavy use of the relatively new Dockerized Cisco 8000 hardware emulator. If you wish to explore Cisco 8000 emulator and its uses beyond the scope of this lab the document team has posted an installation guide here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/8000-series-virtual-router-emulator/series.html

The lab also uses the open-source Containerlab tool for deploying our virtual network topology. More info on Containerlab may be found here: https://containerlab.dev/

And an example containerlab topology using Cisco 8000 HW Emulator running IOS-XR can be found here:
https://github.com/brmcdoug/containerlab/tree/main/vxr8000

### Description: 
In Lab 1 the student will launch the SONiC topology and validate it is up and running. This will be the baseline 
topology for all subsequent lab exercises.

## Lab Objectives
The student upon completion of Lab 1 should have achieved the following objectives:

* Access to all devices in the lab
* Understand the Cisco 8000 Emulator / SONiC stack
* Understanding of the lab topology and components
* Launch the ContainerLab SONiC topology and access the SONiC nodes   

## Virtualization Stack

The software virtualization stack used in this lab consists of several layers. At the base Linux OS level it is possible to run this lab either on bare metal or in a virtualized environment. In our dCloud lab it is running within a hypervisor as a VM. Within the Ubuntu VM named *v-SONiC* we have installed Docker as our container platform. We will user the ContainerLab software to spin up a docker containers that runs the Cisco 8000 hardware emulation software and point the emulator to boot the designated SONiC image. We will spin a single heavy container for each SONiC router needed. See the below diagram.

![Software Stack](../topo-drawings/software-stack.png)

## Validate Device Access

Device access for this lab is primarly through SSH. All of the VMs within this toplogy can be accessed once you connect through Cisco AnyConnect VPN to the dCloud environment. Please see the management topology network diagram below. In addition we will launch four SONiC routers instances running as containers on the VM host "vSONiC". The vSONiC VM acts as a jumpbox for these containerized routers, thus we will SSH into the vSONiC VM and then initiate a separate SSH session to each of the routers. The vSONiC VM is configured for DNS resolution for each router name to save time.

### User Credentials
For the vSONiC VM use the following credentials:
```
User: cisco, Password: C1sco12345
```

For all instances you will use the same user credentials:
```
User: cisco, Password: cisco123
```

### Management Network Topology

### Validate VM Endpoints


## Launch and Validate SONiC Topology
### Validate vSONiC State
1. SSH to the Ubuntu VM **vSONiC** where we will launch the XRd routers
    ```
    ssh cisco@198.18.128.100
    ```

2. Change to the Git repository directory and check status
    - The lab repository folder is found in the home directory *`~/sonic-dcloud/`*
    ```
    cd ~/sonic-dcloud/
    ```
    - The repository should automatically update on the lab spin-up. Validate this.
    ```
    git fetch -v
    ```
    ```
    cisco@vsonic:~/sonic-dcloud$ git fetch -v
    From https://github.com/scurvy-dog/sonic-dcloud
    = [up to date]      main       -> origin/main
    ```
    If it is not up to date then you need to update the repository before launching. Run
   ```
   git pull
   ```

4. Validate there are no docker containers running in our SONiC/Containerlab topology
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    ```
    cisco@vsonic:~/sonic-dcloud/$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
    ```
### Launch Container Lab Environment
1. Change into the lab-1 directory and run the *`nets.sh`* script. This script will built linux bridge instances to connect our SONiC nodes with the external endpoint VMs.
   ```
   cd ~/sonic-dcloud/1-Intro_to_SONiC_Lab/lab_1
   sudo ./nets.sh
   ```
   Confirm bridges were created succesfully
   ```
   brctl show
   ```
   ```
   cisco@vsonic:~/sonic-dcloud/1-Intro_to_SONiC_Lab/lab_1$ brctl show
   bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
   docker0		8000.0242abf3a8e0	no		
   leaf01e32-host1		8000.005056a9ff8a	no		eth1
   leaf02e32-host2		8000.005056a992aa	no		eth2
   ```
    
2. Use Containerlab to launch the topology
    ```
    sudo containerlab deploy -t clab-topology.yml
    ```

   Expected Output
   ```
   cisco@vsonic:~/sonic-dcloud/1-Intro_to_SONiC_Lab/lab_1$ sudo containerlab deploy -t clab-topology.yml

    > **Note**
    > Containerlab command to shutdown the topology:
    ```
    sudo containerlab destroy -t clab-topology.yml
    ```
    
3. Check that the docker containers were created and running
    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    ```
    cisco@vsonic:~/sonic-dcloud/1-Intro_to_SONiC_Lab/lab_1$ docker ps

    > **Note**
    > It takes 10-15 minutes for the C8000 HW Emulators to load the SONiC image, detect virtual hardware and boot up. You can monitor progress using the docker logs command

    ```
    docker logs clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01
    ```

4. After 10-15 minutes validate the SONiC instance started in each container. 
   Use the docker log command to search to see if the SONiC router started successfully. Repeat command for each container name.
   
   - clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01
   - clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf02
   - clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-spine01
   - clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-spine02
   
   ```
   docker logs clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01 | grep Router
   ```
   ```
   cisco@vsonic:~$ docker logs clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01 | grep Router
   Router up
   ```
> **Warning**
> It is possible that the Containerlab process failed to start the router SONiC image after the docker container was created. If you see a *Router failed to come up* message follow the below process.

1. Docker exec into container bash shell:
   ```
   docker exec -it clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf02 bash
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   cisco@vsonic:~$ docker exec -it clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01 bash
   root@leaf01:/#
   ```
2. cd into the *`nobackup`* directory and manually run the startup.py script. We're manually re-applying/booting the SONiC image, so expect the script to run for about 10-15 minutes
   
    > **Note** 
    > The script wants an interface count. In the containerlab topology our spine nodes have 4 interfaces and leaf nodes have 5:
   ```
   cd nobackup
   ./startup.py 8000.yaml 5
   ```
   Example:
```
cisco@vsonic:~$ docker exec -it clab-c8201-sonic-4-node-clos-leaf01 bash
root@leaf01:/# cd nobackup/
root@leaf01:/nobackup# ./startup.py 8000.yaml 5

3. At the *`Sim up`* message you can exit the container and proceed to ssh to the routers

### Connect to Routers

1. Starting from the vSONiC VM log into each router instance 1-4 per the management topology diagram above. Example:
    ```
    ssh cisco@172.10.10.2
    or
    ssh cisco@spine01
    pw = cisco123
    ```
Example:
```
cisco@vsonic:~$ ssh cisco@172.10.10.2
