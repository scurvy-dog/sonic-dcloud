## Lab Objectives
The student upon completion of Lab 3 should have achieved the following objectives:

* Understand FRR configuration
* How to validate and troubleshoot BGP sesions
* Valadiate end to end topology 

## FRR BGP Overview
FRR is the routing procotol software stack in this lab. FRR supports BGP and is integrated within SONiC running it's own daemon to process the configuration work we will be doing in this lab. There are several ways to configure FRR as noted in Lab 2. 

For this lab we will be using two mechanisms to configure FRR. The first is to use ansible to update the FRR config file */etc/sonic/frr/bgpd.conf*. When we do a config reload command it will load FRR will load the BGP configurations into the running configuration which is stored in the *redis-database*. We will use this method to load FRR/BGP configuration for *spine01*, *spine02*, and *leaf02*.

For *leaf01* you will be using the FRR CLI to add the BGP configuration. There are some items of note when using the FRR CLI in SONiC.
    - For all configuration commands, the CLI request is converted to a corresponding REST client SDK request based on the Open Config data model that was generated by the Swagger generator, and is given to the REST server
    - From there on it will follow the same path as a REST config request for create, update and delete operations

## BGP Topology
In this lab we will have three separate BGP AS represented in the fabric. The spine layer will be within it's own AS 65000. Each leaf will then have it's own separate BGP AS as represented in the topology diagram below. In this BGP DC fabric the leafs should be receiving equal cost paths through each of the spine layer port-channels through AS 65000.

## Ansible BGP Playbook
In Lab 3 we are going to use an Ansible playbook to create the BGP configuration in the topology. That means we are going to replace the */etc/sonic/frr/bgpd.conf* file which will contain FRR BGP parameters. 

There are several relevant files for our ansible playbook

| Name                  | Location                     | Notes                         |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------|
| lab_3-playbook.yml    | /lab_3/ansible               | Ansible playbook file         |
| hosts                 | /lab_3/ansible               | Contains device list and IPs  |
| frr.conf              | /lab_3/ansible/files/{host}/ | FRR BGP file -> bgpd.conf     |

- Change to the ansible directory in Lab 3
  ```
  cd ansible
  ```
- Run Ansible playbook to copy configurations to SONiC routers. Once copied then load configurations
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i hosts lab_3-playbook.yml -e "ansible_user=cisco ansible_ssh_pass=cisco123 ansible_sudo_pass=cisco123" -vv
    ```

    You should expect a large amount of output from ansible but, at the end of logs look for the following output
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ansible playbook configured router *spine01*, *spine02*, and *leaf02*. You will manually configure BGP for router *leaf01* in this lab.

## Configure BGP Leaf01 with FRR CLI
1. Enter into the FRR CLI shell
   ```
   vtysh
   ```
2. Enter into FRR configuration mode.
   ```
   config terminal
   ```
3. Start with the base BGP configuration. For *leaf01* we will be using AS65004 per the topology diagram.
   ```
   router bgp 65004
   bgp router-id 10.0.0.4
   bgp log-neighbor-changes
   no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
   no bgp default ipv4-unicast
   bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
   neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65000
   neighbor 10.1.1.3 remote-as 65000
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 remote-as 65000
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 remote-as 65000
   ```
4. Next we will add the IPv4 Unicast configuration
   ```
   address-family ipv4 unicast
   network 10.0.0.4/32
   neighbor 10.1.1.1 activate
   neighbor 10.1.1.3 activate
   exit-address-family
   ```
5. Now add the IPv6 Unicast configuration
   ```
   address-family ipv6 unicast
   network fc00:0:4::/48
   network fc00:0:::1/128
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 activate
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 activate
   exit-address-family
   exit
   ```
6. Verify the new running configuration in FRR
   ```
   leaf01# show running-config
   ...
   router bgp 65004
     bgp router-id 10.0.0.4
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
     no bgp default ipv4-unicast
     bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65000        <---- Spine01 IPv4 Peer
     neighbor 10.1.1.3 remote-as 65000        <---- Spine02 IPv4 Peer
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 remote-as 65000  <---- Spine01 IPv6 Peer
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 remote-as 65000  <---- Spine02 IPv6 Peer
   !
   address-family ipv4 unicast
     network 10.0.0.4/32                      <---- Advertise local IPv4 network 
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 activate
     neighbor 10.1.1.3 activate
   exit-address-family
   !
   address-family ipv6 unicast
     network fc00:0:4::/48                     <---- Advertise local IPv6 network
     network fc00:0:4::1/128                   <---- Advertise local IPv6 network
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 activate
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 activate
   exit-address-family
   exit
   !
   ```
## Validate BGP Peering

### Verify BGP Peering Sessions
- Verify that BGP peering sessions are established with *spine01* and *spine02* from leaf01
  ```
  show ip bgp summary
  ```
  ```
   leaf01# show ip bgp summary
