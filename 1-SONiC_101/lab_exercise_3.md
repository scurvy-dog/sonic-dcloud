## Lab Objectives
The student upon completion of Lab 3 should have achieved the following objectives:

* Understand FRR configuration
* How to validate and troubleshoot FRR BGP sessions
* Valadiate end to end topology 

## FRR BGP Overview
For this lab we will be using two mechanisms to configure FRR. The first is to use ansible to update the FRR config file */etc/sonic/frr/bgpd.conf* on three of the four routers. When we do a config reload command it will load the FRR/BGP configurations into the running configuration which is stored in the *redis-database*. We will use this method to load FRR/BGP configuration for *spine-1*, *spine-2*, and *leaf-2*.

For *leaf-1* we'll invoke the FRR CLI and add BGP configuration there. 

>:memo: **Item of Note**. 
> For all FRR configuration commands, the CLI request is converted to a corresponding REST client SDK request
> based on the Open Config datamodel that was generated by the Swagger generator, and is given to the REST server.
> From there on it will follow the same path as a REST config request for create, update and delete operations

## BGP Topology
In this lab we will have three separate BGP AS represented in the fabric. The spine layer will run a single AS 65000. Each leaf will run a separate BGP AS as represented in the topology diagram below. In this BGP DC fabric the leafs should be receiving equal cost paths through each of the spine layer port-channels via AS 65000.

## Ansible BGP Playbook
The lab_exercise_3 Ansible playbook will replace the */etc/sonic/frr/bgpd.conf* file in leaf-2 and both spine nodes, and will then restart the BGP containers.  

There are several relevant files for our ansible playbook

| Name                        | Location               | Notes                         |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|
| lab_exercise_3-playbook.yml | /ansible               | Ansible playbook file         |
| hosts                       | /ansible               | Contains device list and IPs  |
| frr.conf                    | /ansible/files/{host}/ | FRR BGP file -> bgpd.conf     |

- Change to the ansible directory
  ```
  cd ansible
  ```
- From the jumpbox VM run Ansible playbook to copy configurations to SONiC routers and restart BGP/FRR docker containers
    ```
    ansible-playbook -i hosts lab_exercise_3-playbook.yml -e "ansible_user=cisco ansible_ssh_pass=cisco123 ansible_sudo_pass=cisco123" -vv
    ```

    You should expect a large amount of output from ansible but, at the end of logs look for the following output
    ```

    ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ansible playbook configured router *spine-1*, *spine-2*, and *leaf-2*. Next we'll manually configure BGP for router *leaf-1*.
   
## Configure BGP Leaf-1 with FRR CLI
1. SSH to leaf-1 (ssh cisco@leaf-1) and invoke the FRR CLI shell
   ```
   vtysh
   ```
2. Enter into FRR configuration mode.
   ```
   config terminal
   ```
3. Start with the base BGP configuration. For *leaf-1* we will be using AS65001 per the topology diagram.
   ```
   router bgp 65001
   bgp router-id 10.0.0.1
   bgp log-neighbor-changes
   no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
   no bgp default ipv4-unicast
   timers bgp 3 9
   bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
   neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65000
   neighbor 10.1.1.3 remote-as 65000
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 remote-as 65000
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 remote-as 65000
   ```
4. Next we will add the IPv4 Unicast configuration
   ```
   address-family ipv4 unicast
   network 10.0.0.1/32
   network 198.18.11.0/24
   neighbor 10.1.1.1 activate
   neighbor 10.1.1.3 activate
   exit-address-family
   ```
5. Now add the IPv6 Unicast configuration
   ```
   address-family ipv6 unicast
   network fc00:0:1::/48
   network fc00:0:1::1/128
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 activate
   neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 activate
   exit-address-family
   exit
   ```
6. Verify the new running configuration in FRR
   ```
   leaf-1# show running-config
   ...
   router bgp 65001
     bgp router-id 10.0.0.1
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
     no bgp default ipv4-unicast
     bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
     timers bgp 3 9
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 65000        <---- spine-1 IPv4 Peer
     neighbor 10.1.1.3 remote-as 65000        <---- spine-2 IPv4 Peer
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 remote-as 65000  <---- spine-1 IPv6 Peer
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 remote-as 65000  <---- spine-2 IPv6 Peer
   !
   address-family ipv4 unicast
     network 10.0.0.1/32                      <---- Advertise local IPv4 network
     network 198.18.11.0/24                   <---- Advertise "endpoint" IPv4 network
     neighbor 10.1.1.1 activate
     neighbor 10.1.1.3 activate
   exit-address-family
   !
   address-family ipv6 unicast
     network fc00:0:1::/48                     <---- Advertise local IPv6 network
     network fc00:0:1::1/128                   <---- Advertise local IPv6 network
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::1 activate
     neighbor fc00:0:ffff::3 activate
   exit-address-family
   exit
   !
   ```
## Validate BGP Peering

### Verify BGP Peering Sessions
- Verify that BGP peering sessions are established with *spine-1* and *spine-2* from *leaf-1*

### Verify BGP Routing Table
- **Verify IPv4** routes. *leaf-1* should have received the following
  ```
  show ip route bgp
  ```
  ```

  ```

- *leaf-2* should show similar output.
  
- Examine IPv4 BGP AS Path information in the route table. This shows us what routes are installed in the BGP table vs which routes are installed into the routing table.

### IPv4 BGP Route Validation Walk Through
- Validate IPv4 BGP route received from peer. We will examine *10.0.0.2/32* originated from *leaf-2*

- Validate route was received from *spine-1* and *spine-2* and added to the BGP table
  ```
  show ip bgp 10.0.0.2/32
  ```
  ```
  leaf-1# show ip bgp 10.0.0.2/32
  BGP routing table entry for 10.0.0.2/32, version 4
  Paths: (2 available, best #1, table default)
    Advertised to non peer-group peers:
    10.1.1.1 10.1.1.3
    65000 65002
      10.1.1.1 from 10.1.1.1 (10.0.0.3)
        Origin IGP, valid, external, multipath, best (Router ID)
        Last update: Mon Sep 18 20:37:32 2023
    65000 65002
      10.1.1.3 from 10.1.1.3 (10.0.0.4)
        Origin IGP, valid, external, multipath
        Last update: Mon Sep 18 20:37:32 2023
  ```
- Validate that BGP route was installed into the routing information base (RIB)
  ```
  show ip route 10.0.0.2/32
  ```
  ```
  leaf-1# show ip route 10.0.0.2/32
  Routing entry for 10.0.0.2/32
    Known via "bgp", distance 20, metric 0, best
    Last update 00:10:55 ago
    * 10.1.1.1, via PortChannel1, weight 1
    * 10.1.1.3, via PortChannel2, weight 1
  ```

### Validate the route was installed in the Linux forwarding table (SONiC's FIB)

1. Exit the FRR CLI and then from Linux:
  ```
  cisco@leaf-1:~$ ip route
  ...
  10.0.0.2 nhid 111 proto bgp src 10.0.0.1 metric 20 
	nexthop via 10.1.1.1 dev PortChannel1 weight 1 
	nexthop via 10.1.1.3 dev PortChannel2 weight 1
  ```

## Validate SONiC End to End Connectivity

- From *leaf-1* we will ping the *loopback0* interface on *leaf-2*
  ```
  ping 10.0.0.2
  ```
  ```
  leaf-1# ping 10.0.0.2
  PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=101 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=276 ms
  ```

### Validate Endpoint VM reachability

__Endpoint-1__

Endpoint-1 VM represents a standard linux host or endpoint connected to leaf-1

1. Open a new terminal and SSH to Endpoint-1 Client VM
   ```
   ssh cisco@198.18.128.105
   ```

2. Ping Endpoint-2
   ```
   ping 198.18.12.2
   ```
   ```
   cisco@endpoint-1:~$ ping 198.18.12.1
   PING 198.18.12.1 (198.18.12.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 198.18.12.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=698 ms
   64 bytes from 198.18.12.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=372 ms
   ```

__Endpoint-2__

The Endpiont-2 VM represents a standard linux host or endpoint connected to leaf-2

1. In another terminal SSH to Endpoint-2 Client VM
   ```
   ssh cisco@198.18.128.106
   ```
2. Ping Endpoint-1
   ```
   ping 198.18.11.2
   ```
   ```
   cisco@endpoint-2:~$ ping 198.18.11.2
   PING 198.18.11.2 (198.18.11.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 198.18.11.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=61 time=177 ms
   64 bytes from 198.18.11.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=61 time=4.19 ms
   ```
