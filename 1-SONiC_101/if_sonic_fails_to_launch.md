# SONiC Node Failure Instructions

## When to use?
There are two potential scenarioes where trouble may happen with the SONiC node. In both cases the fastest remediation is to have the container torn down and rebuilt. Be aware that once the container is back up and running configuration would need to be reapplied.

### Issue Scenarios
1. Initial SONiC node fails to populate interfaces from the Cisco 8000 Emulator
2. The SONiC node has general container instability which can happen in the virtual environment

## Step by Step Instructions

1. ssh to the sonic node's host VM:

     | Host name  | IP Address     |
     |:-----------|:---------------|
     | linux-host-1  | 198.18.128.101 |
     | linux-host-2  | 198.18.128.102 |
     | linux-host-3 | 198.18.128.103 |
     | linux-host-4 | 198.18.128.104 |

2. Determine the local SONiC/8000 container's name:
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   cisco@linux-host-4:~$ docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
   d1861990e9a8   c8000-clab-sonic:31   "/etc/prepEnv.sh /noâ€¦"   21 minutes ago   Up 21 minutes             clab-c8101-sonic-sonic-rtr-spine-2
   cisco@linux-host-4:~$
   ```

3. Access the docker container through an exec shell:
   ```
   docker exec -it <container name or ID> bash
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   docker exec -it clab-c8101-sonic-sonic-rtr-spine-2 bash
   ```

4. change directory into 'nobackup'
   ```
   cd nobackup
   ```

5. Run the startup.sh shell script as follows:

   If *sonic-rtr-leaf-1* or *sonic-rtr-leaf-2* failed:
   ```
   ./startup.sh 8000.yaml 5
   ```

   if *sonic-rtr-spine-1* or *sonic-rtr-spine-2* failed:
   ```
   ./startup.sh 8000.yaml 4
   ```

6. The script will output log info very similar to the docker logs info. The script will monitor the SONiC node and test to see if the Cisco 8000 emulator has created interfaces for the SONiC node. Expect about 10-12 minutes to see a 'Router up' message. 

   Truncated example output:
   ```
   cisco@sonic-rtr-spine-2:~$ docker exec -it  clab-c8101-sonic-sonic-rtr-spine-2 bash
